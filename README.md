I decided to teach myself some basic `html` for fun and created my first website! It's a pro-wrestling championship page for my e-Fed that I run using *Fire Pro Wrestling World*. My e-fed focuses on the rosters and championships of *New Japan Pro-Wrestling* (NJPW) and *Pro Wrestling NOAH* (NOAH), as well as the Triple Crown Heavyweight from *All Japan Pro-Wrestling* and a few other catch-all titles named off the real one. Displays my current champions and some other basic info. All singles championships have their own links to display their complete lineage and defenses. Also, mini-profile images for each wrestler. I may update this as my e-Fed continues, or maybe not. \
