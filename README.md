I decided to teach myself some basic `html` for fun and created my first website! It's a pro-wrestling championship page for my e-Fed that I run using *Fire Pro Wrestling World*. My e-fed focuses on the rosters and championships of *New Japan Pro-Wrestling* (NJPW), *Pro Wrestling: NOAH* (NOAH), and other Japanese (All Japan Pro Wrestling, DDT, Dragongate, etc.) and global promotions (AEW, CMLL). Displays my current champions and some other basic info. Some championships have their own links to display their complete lineage and defenses. Also, mini-profile images for each wrestler. I may update this as my e-Fed continues, or maybe not. \
